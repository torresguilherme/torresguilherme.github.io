### Feel free to contact me for any reasons.

Whether you want to make me a job offer, which is highly appreciated by the way, or if you want to give me feedback on any of my work, or if you want to ask something about my code, or if you have a request, or if you just want to tell me how much of a cool guy you think I am. I got you covered. Just don't take it personal if I take a lot of time to respond or if I don't, at all. I have lots of ongoing projects and I mainly concentrate my time on them.

My social email is [guilhermetorres97@gmail.com](http://gmail.com). That's where you send informal stuff or if you want a quick answer.

My institutional email is [torres@dcc.ufmg.br](http://dcc.ufmg.br). Please use it for academy-related stuff.

# Answers some questions you might have:

### How are you?

Maybe I'm fine. Maybe not. You can just assume things are going OK for me.

### Can I use your code/music/art for something?

Please check the license of the content for that. I usually share my work with free software licenses (MIT or Apache depending if I plan on patenting the technology or not) or Creative Commons, and when I don't, I state it pretty clearly. Of course, if you wanna use my art in your video or game or whatever, proper attribution is something that you should consider giving as a decent human being.

### I have a job offer related to programming, are you available for hire?

At the moment I'm studying and doing research at the Computer Vision and Robotics Laboratory at the Federal University of Minas Gerais and finishing my Computer Science degree. So, I'm already busy, but if you have a good offer, especially something involving research on computer vision/graphics, sure, we can talk about it.

### I'm looking for a front-end web dev. Are you interested?

No.

### How did you make this website? I want one too!

I used Hugo as a static generator and the Niello theme. Thanks guangmean for that!

### Why does this website suck?

It's purposely done so that no one wants to hire me as a front-end web dev.
