      <description>This is the hardest, most complex post of this series. Bonus points if you understand everything. Light is a fundamental part of graphics, and today we learn how to emit it and how to react to it. And there are many, many (did I say many? there are many, just in case I didn&amp;rsquo;t make myself clear) ways of programming illumination in graphics. Some are better than others overall, some are more costly, some are just well-suited for real-time rendering like video games.</description>

      <description>Breathe. Focus. Let&amp;rsquo;s go. Credits to https://github.com/danielepanozzo/cg for some of the images used in the interpolation sections.
I hope the maths didn&amp;rsquo;t scare you away in the last post. If you stuck around after the last read, that&amp;rsquo;s very good, because you just went past one of the fundamental topics of graphics. But now that you know what to do with the model points before rendering, now you should know what are exactly our models.</description>

      <description>Are you ready? This is when things get nasty. I advise you to read this post thrice if you really want to know what is going on. What I&amp;rsquo;m about to say here is essential to graphics and heavily relies on linear algebra, so I hope you did your homework. And without further ado, let&amp;rsquo;s get started.
The preliminaries, or, what is a point, or a direction, and a matrix The most essential element of the Euclidean geometry and one of the things that every high school or college student in STEM had to deal with but yet, it is so hard to explain.</description>

      <description>Computer graphics has been one of my favorite topics to both study and cover in the last few years. In this series of posts, I intend to give you, whoever is reading this, the basic knowledge you need to know your way around this beautiful field of study, whether your intention is to be able to read papers about it, or to build applications, or just to impress your friends with knowledge.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about starting this website for some time now. To make myself a place where I can dump what I think about tech, programming, music, and whatever I&amp;rsquo;m doing in my spare time. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if you ended up here because I sent you a link related to this website, which is the most likely, or someone else did, or you&amp;rsquo;ve just been stalking me and found this.</description>
