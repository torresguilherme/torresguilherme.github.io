To make myself a place where I can dump what I think about tech, programming, music, and whatever I&rsquo;m doing in my spare time.</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if you ended up here because I sent you a link related to this website, which is the most likely, or someone else did, or you&rsquo;ve just been stalking me and found this. Whatever it was, welcome to my personal little corner. This is what I&rsquo;m currently using as my online curriculum as well, so, if you want to contact me for professional or academic reasons, I also got you covered. And I hope the stuff I have to say light a little bit of interest in your mind as well.</p>

<p>The topics I will cover here, especially in the computer graphics and vision topics, are not for the faint of heart and maybe you won&rsquo;t be able to understand everything I say in a few minutes. Don&rsquo;t be discouraged by that, I also didn&rsquo;t learn all of that in real time, so to speak. Some things will require you a little bit of university-level mathematics to understand, like linear algebra, analytic geometry and calculus with one or more variables, and I won&rsquo;t teach that because, first of all, I don&rsquo;t think I am the right person to do it, and there is plenty of material around the internet where you can learn this.</p>

<p>What I intend is to produce material which I believe it&rsquo;s lacking, especially in Portuguese, which is my mother tongue. I see plenty of material on how to print &ldquo;Hello world&rdquo; in over 50 programming languages, or on how to draw a triangle in OpenGL, or good programming practices, or hell, whether you should enroll in a computer science major or not. I probably won&rsquo;t touch these topics here since I noticed they&rsquo;ve been overcovered already. Instead, I&rsquo;ll do what I think I do well and this world needs, as smug as that may sound.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t post here that frequently as well, some months I may not post at all. That doesn&rsquo;t mean I died or stopped supporting my own blog, it just means that I have other priorities aside from writing here.</p>

<p>And I won&rsquo;t make this much longer because if I do no one will read this, so, that&rsquo;s it. Suit yourself. And if you have any feedback, questions or requests, feel free to contact me.</p>
